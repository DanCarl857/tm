This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Poppins](https://vercel.com/font) as its font. We also use [`shadcn`]() for atomic components and [`react-icons`]() for it's icon set.

## Features 

A simple task manager application with a simple login screen:

- Once you have the application running, login using email `admin@baotech.com` and password `admin123`
- Once you have logged in, the application automatically logs you in on subsequent visits.
